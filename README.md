# HealthAndSuccess

### Goal
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning pipeline that predicts academic outcomes using student health data in the San Francisco Bay Area.

### Motivation
I decided to pursue this project because of my interest in education and the many factors that impact a student's success in the classroom. Initially, I considered using social and/or economic factors to predict success but I felt that it's been done many times before. I haven't heard of many studies being done using student health so I was interested in seeing how that might affect academic outcomes. Health is composed of a variety of factors, not just being sick, which will be taken into account here. It may be the case that there is no relation or a relationship is present in conjunction with societal and economic factors. For example, a student may miss a large number of days of school because they're sick but have access to a tutor so they don't fall behind. This is just a stepping stone that may lead to a much larger project.
